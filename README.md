# Scale-unwinder-3dp
A ESP32 driven Scale, Adjustable spoolwidth, esp touch for tare, offset 1, offset 2

For my recuring plates i need to know the remaining Filamet on spool. 
As my wife hated me a ton for taking away her kitchen scale every day, this here became my solution.

You can hardcode two offsets(empty spoolweights) and select them by touching the screws below the display.
